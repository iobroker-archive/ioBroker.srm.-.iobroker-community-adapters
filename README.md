## Introduction

This is an iobroker adapter to connect to [Synology](https://www.synology.com/) routers. The adapter uses the Synology API to get the data. The adapter is tested with the SRM version 1.3.1. and router model RT6600 but should work with other models as well.

Thanks to 

* [Nocilas](https://github.com/nioc) who provider the connector for the Synology API.
* The countless iobroker adapters that I used as a template, especially [asuswrt](https://github.com/mcdhrts/ioBroker.asuswrt).

### Objects
The adapter creates the following objects:

## router
* IPV4_IP: IP4 address of the router
* IPV4_status: Status of the IPV4 connection
* IPV6_IP: IP6 address of the router
* IPV6_status: Status of the IPV4 connection

## devices
JSON table for the following device states:

* all: All known devices
* mesh: All mesh devices
* online: All online devices
* online_ethernet: All online devices connected via ethernet
* online wifi: All online devices connected via wifi

Each JSON table has the following objects for each device:

* connection: Connection type (Eternet, Wifi)
* dev_type: Device type (Computer, Mobile, etc.)
* hostname: Hostname of the device
* ip6_addr: IP6 address of the device
* ip_addr: IP4 address of the device
* is_banned: Is the device banned
* is_beamforming_on: Is beamforming enabled
* is_high_qos_on: Is high QOS enabled
* is_low_qos_on: Is low QOS enabled
* is_manual_device_type: Is the device type manually set
* is_manual_hostname: Is the hostname manually set
* is_online: Is the device online
* is_qos_on: Is QOS enabled
* is_wireless: Is the device connected via wifi
* mac: MAC address of the device
* mesh_node_id: ID of the mesh node
* mesh_node_name: Name of the mesh node

## info
* connection: Status of the connection to the router

## mesh
List of mesh nodes. Each mesh nodes has the following objects:

* band: Uplink band
* connected_devices: Number of connected devices
* current_tx_rate: Current transmission rate
* current_rx_rate: Current reception rate
* name: Name of the mesh node
* network_status: Status of the network
* node_id: ID of the mesh node
* node_status: Status of the mesh node
* parent_node_id: ID of the parent node

### Sentry

What is Sentry.io and what is reported to the servers of that company? `Sentry.io` is a service for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or another Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error.
